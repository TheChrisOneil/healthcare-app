# System Overview
The healthcare transcription system handles real-time audio streaming, transcription using AWS Transcribe, and integration with NATS for inter-service communication. It uses WebSockets for frontend-backend communication and supports extensibility with additional backend agents (e.g., Order Agent, AoF Agent).

---

# Module Responsibilities
### Transcription Agent
- Accepts audio streams via WebSocket.
- Sends audio to AWS Transcribe for real-time transcription.
- Publishes transcription results to NATS.

### Frontend
- Streams audio to the backend.
- Displays transcription results in real time.

### API Gateway
- Routes WebSocket and HTTP requests to appropriate backend services.

---

# Current Performance and Issues
### Observations
- **WebSocket Connection Stability**:
  - WebSocket connections sometimes close prematurely.
  - Requires robust handling of lifecycle events.

- **AWS Transcribe Behavior**:
  - Successfully handles smaller streams.
  - Larger streams need optimization.

### Technical Debt
1. **Logging**:
   - Refactor logging into a shared utility for consistency across services.
2. **Concurrency**:
   - Optimize transcription agent for handling multiple WebSocket connections.
3. **Testing**:
   - Add automated tests for long-duration audio streams.

# Unresolved Decisions
- Should fallback transcription engines be explored for non-AWS environments?
- Is there a more efficient audio format or encoding for AWS Transcribe?

---

# Next Steps
- Refactor `transcription-agent.py` to centralize logging configuration.
- Investigate WebSocket reconnection strategies in the frontend.
- Stress-test the system with simultaneous connections and larger audio streams.
